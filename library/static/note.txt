Let's say you have three function in a static library one(), two() , three()

but in the main file you are calling just one()

Then when you create an executable only one() function definition from the library is added into executable.
If you call  one(), two() and three() then alll of them will be a part of executable.

How to create a library:

 create objects
 gcc -c *.c


 create library
 ar rcs mylib.a *.o


Usage
gcc main.c mylib.a
